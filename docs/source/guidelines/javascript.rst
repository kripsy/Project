Javascript
==========

We try to keep our code style as close as we can to
`Google Code Style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml>`_.

Unfortunately, because of our legacy code, we had to make a few
exceptions. The best way to understand it is to read our
`ESlint config <https://github.com/google/ggrc-core/blob/develop/.eslintrc.json>`_
and check the exceptions on their official
`website <http://eslint.org/docs/rules/>`_.
