Feature: Many resources have links to other resources. This feature will
  exercise the cases where the linking is n to 1, such as in a child to parent
  relationship.

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline:
    Given a new "<parent_type>" named "parent"
    And "parent" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "<child_type>" named "child"
    And "child" link property "<parent_property>" is "parent"
    And "child" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "parent"
    And GET of the resource "child"
    Then the "<parent_property>" of "child" is a link to "parent"
    And "child" is in the links property "<children_property>" of "parent" 

  Examples: n-ary Link Resources
