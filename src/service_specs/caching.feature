Feature: Resource caching
  I would like resources to be cached:
    I would like to have objects cached on repeated loads when using `id__in`
    I would like to have the cache entry invalidated on PUT
    I would like to have the cache entry removed on DELETE

  I would like resources to be expired due to mapping-object changes:
    I would like to have objects cached on repeated loads when using `id__in`
    I would like to have the cache entry invalidated after POST of mapping
    I would like to have the cache entry invalidated after PUT of mapping
    I would like to have the cache entry invalidated after DELETE of mapping

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline: Caching Misses and Hits
    Given a new "<resource_type>" named "example_resource"
    And "example_resource" property "<property>" is "<value1>"
    And "example_resource" is POSTed to its collection

    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Miss"
    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Hit"

    When GET of the resource "example_resource"
    And "example_resource" property "<property>" is "<value2>"
    And PUT "example_resource"
    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Miss"
    And the value of the "<table_plural>_collection.<table_plural>.0.<property>" property of the "collectionresource" is "<value2>"
    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Hit"
    And the value of the "<table_plural>_collection.<table_plural>.0.<property>" property of the "collectionresource" is "<value2>"

    When GET of the resource "example_resource"
    And DELETE "example_resource"
    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Miss"
    And the "<table_plural>_collection.<table_plural>" property of the "collectionresource" is empty
    When GET of "<resource_type>" collection using id__in for "example_resource"
    Then the response has a header "X-GGRC-Cache"
    And the response header "X-GGRC-Cache" is "Miss"
    And the "<table_plural>_collection.<table_plural>" property of the "collectionresource" is empty
